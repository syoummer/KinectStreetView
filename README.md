# Kinect Street View #
## Simin You ##
### Version 0.0.1###
Using Kinect to control Google street view. 
Supports "zoom in", "zoom out", "walk", "turn left", "turn right".

This project depends on Kinect viewer from Kinect SDK 1.6 (for visulizing Kinect output), and [InputSimulator](http://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/) (for keyboard hacking)

Special thanks to [Yan](http://lab.grapeot.me "Yan") for tremendous help!
